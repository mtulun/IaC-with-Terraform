# IaC-with-Terraform
Infrastructure management on AWS using Terraform

You can have credentials for many diffrent AWS accounts in the same credentials file by using profiles.

By default, the credentials file is stored here:

• On Windows: C:\Users\ ![#f03c15](username) `#f03c15` \.aws\credentials
• On Mac/Linux: ~/.aws/credentials
